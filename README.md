Git etiquette for the less experienced of us will be included in here later.

For those of us that are using git and github for the first time, please read the following:

To pull changes that are on the repo but not on your local folder, do this:
```git pull```

Adding your changes to the repo is as follows:
```git add -A```
```git commit -a``` and write your commit description
```git push origin main```

If you have any problems or questions, shoot a message to Nico, Nathan, or Tooth.

Happy Hunting!
